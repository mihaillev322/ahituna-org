<h1>About Ahi Tuna: Our Standards for Ahi Tuna Guidance</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Mission and audience</h2>
<p>Ahi Tuna serves an international audience seeking reliable, safety-first guidance on yellowfin tuna ahi—from selecting fresh steaks to mastering ahi tuna preparation methods. We recognise that terminology varies across markets: "ahi" is Hawaiian for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), yet labelling practices differ by region, and species identification remains critical for quality and sustainability.</p>
<p>Our mission is to bridge these differences by providing dual-unit measurements (metric and imperial), clarifying regional naming conventions, and prioritising food safety whether you're searing steaks, preparing poke bowls, or handling sashimi-grade fish. We address common questions—<a href="/faq">storage and cooking times</a>—and help readers confidently answer "where to buy ahi tuna" by explaining cold-chain requirements, freshness indicators, and supplier credentials.</p>
<p>Whether you're a home cook exploring new recipes or a professional seeking sourcing standards, our content respects diverse culinary traditions while maintaining rigorous safety protocols for both raw and cooked preparations of this prized fish.</p>
</section>

<section id="method">
<h2>How we build and review content</h2>
<p>Our editorial method follows a clear source hierarchy: we prioritise guidance from government food-safety agencies, intergovernmental fisheries organisations, peer-reviewed research, and established culinary institutions. When recommendations conflict—such as freezing durations for parasite elimination or mercury advisories for vulnerable populations—we present the most conservative guidance and cite the relevant authority.</p>
<p>Content is reviewed on a quarterly cadence to reflect updated fisheries data, revised food-safety standards, and emerging best practices in seafood handling. Each page undergoes fact-checking against primary sources, including the <a href="https://www.fao.org/fishery/en" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> for species and sustainability information, and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/yellowfin-tuna" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Encyclopædia Britannica</a> for taxonomic and biological accuracy.</p>
<p>We avoid promotional language and affiliate relationships that might compromise objectivity. Our focus remains on equipping readers with the knowledge to assess suppliers, verify labelling, and apply proper storage and cooking techniques. When scientific consensus is incomplete—such as optimal ageing periods for different cuts—we acknowledge uncertainty and provide practical ranges based on industry practice.</p>
<p>All external links are vetted for authority and relevance, and we maintain a transparent update log for material changes to guidance, ensuring readers can trust the currency and integrity of our recommendations.</p>

<section id="table-standards">
<h2>Quality and safety standards we reference</h2>
<p>Our guidance draws on established standards across five critical areas. The table below summarises what we evaluate, why each area matters, and the types of sources we consult to ensure comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations.</p>

<div class="table-container">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Area</th>
<th>What we look for</th>
<th>Why it matters</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cold chain</td>
<td>Continuous refrigeration at 0–4°C (32–39°F) from catch to sale</td>
<td>Prevents bacterial growth and preserves texture, flavour, and safety</td>
<td>FDA seafood HACCP, EU cold-chain regulations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Labelling and species</td>
<td>Accurate species name (Thunnus albacares), catch method, origin</td>
<td>Ensures you receive yellowfin, not substituted species; supports traceability</td>
<td>FAO species fact sheets, national labelling laws</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Freezing documentation for raw use</td>
<td>Proof of freezing at –20°C (–4°F) for 7 days or –35°C (–31°F) for 15 hours</td>
<td>Eliminates parasites for sashimi-grade safety</td>
<td>FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards Guide, EU Regulation 853/2004</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sanitation</td>
<td>Clean cutting surfaces, tools, and hands; separation from raw poultry/meat</td>
<td>Prevents cross-contamination and foodborne illness</td>
<td>WHO food-safety guidelines, national health departments</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cooking temperatures</td>
<td>Internal temp of 63°C (145°F) for fully cooked; searing protocols for rare centre</td>
<td>Destroys pathogens while preserving desired doneness</td>
<td>USDA safe minimum temperatures, culinary institute standards</td>
</tr>

<section id="site-structure">
<h2>How to use this site</h2>
<p>This site is organised into three core pages, each designed to answer specific questions and guide you through the process of buying, storing, and preparing ahi tuna with confidence.</p>
<p>Start with the <a href="/">Home: recipes, nutrition, and buying</a> page for a comprehensive overview. There you'll find an introduction to what "ahi tuna" means in global seafood markets, detailed ahi tuna recipes and preparation methods—including searing, grilling, poke bowls, and sashimi handling—plus nutrition facts, a buying guide with a comparison table of fresh steaks versus frozen sashimi-grade options, and practical advice on price signals and sourcing.</p>
<p>For quick answers to common concerns, visit the <a href="/faq">Ahi tuna FAQ for quick answers</a>. The FAQ covers storage temperatures and timelines, how to identify sashimi-grade fish, recommended cooking times for different thicknesses, nutritional benefits, and where to source high-quality ahi tuna. Each question includes expert context to help you apply the guidance in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>This About Us page explains our editorial standards, the sources we trust, and how we handle conflicting guidance. Together, these three pages provide a complete resource for anyone seeking authoritative, internationally relevant information on yellowfin tuna.</p>
